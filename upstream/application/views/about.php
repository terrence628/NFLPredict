<h1>About The Team</h1>
<p>The Colts was founded in 1944. On November 1958, the Colts clinched their first Western Conference title with a 35-27 win over San Francisco before a record home sellout crowd of 57,557. Four weeks later, Baltimore won its first NFL title, downing the New York Giants, 23-17, in the fabled “sudden-death” overtime contest at Yankee Stadium.
   On September 7, 1947, wearing green and silver uniforms, the Colts, under Head Coach Cecil Isbell, won their initial AAFC game, 16-7, over the Brooklyn Dodgers. The team concluded its inaugural season before a record Baltimore crowd of 51,583 by losing to the New York Yankees, 21-7. The Colts finished with a 2-11-1 record, good for a fourthplace finish in the Eastern Division.
   The Colts won a then-club record 11 consecutive games in 1964, en route to clinching their third conference title. That season, WR-Raymond Berry caught his 506th career pass and RB-Lenny Moore scored 20 touchdowns, then both NFL records.</p>
<p>The Colts were 7-9 in 1990. Meyer earned a 36-35 regular-season record before being succeeded by Rick Venturi on October 1, 1991. The 1995 Colts earned a 9-7 record and gained playoff wins at San Diego and Kansas City before falling, 20-16, at Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game. The Colts were 10-6 in 2000, but lost in overtime at Miami, 23-17, in the Wild Card round. The back-to-back
    10-plus-victory seasons were a first for the club since 1976-77. In 2006, the Colts were 12-4 and captured the fourth world championship in franchise history with a 29-17 win over Chicago in Super Bowl XLI in Miami Gardens, Fla. The club defeated Chicago after besting three prior playoffs foes, Kansas City (23-8), Baltimore (15-6) and New England (38-34).</p>
<p>The 2012 Colts faced one of the most unique years in franchise history. The team quickly experienced adversity when their head coach, Chuck Pagano, was diagnosed with leukemia four weeks into the season. The Colts rallied around their ailing head coach and the “CHUCKSTRONG” campaign en route to accomplishing one of their main goals – extending the season for Pagano’s return. In 60 years of National Football League competition, the Colts have achieved a 495-442-7 record, including four
    world championships and 20 conference or division titles.</p>
